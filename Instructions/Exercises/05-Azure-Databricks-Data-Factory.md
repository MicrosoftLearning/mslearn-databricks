# Automate an Azure Databricks Notebook with Azure Data Factory

You can use notebooks in Azure Databricks to perform data engineering tasks, such as processing data files and loading data into tables. When you need to orchestrate these tasks as part of a data engineering pipeline, you can use Azure Data Factory.

This exercise should take approximately **40** minutes to complete.

## Provision an Azure Databricks workspace

> **Tip**: If you already have an Azure Databricks workspace, you can skip this procedure and use your existing workspace.

This exercise includes a script to provision a new Azure Databricks workspace. The script attempts to create a *Premium* tier Azure Databricks workspace resource in a region in which your Azure subscription has sufficient quota for the compute cores required in this exercise; and assumes your user account has sufficient permissions in the subscription to create an Azure Databricks workspace resource. If the script fails due to insufficient quota or permissions, you can try to [create an Azure Databricks workspace interactively in the Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/getting-started/#--create-an-azure-databricks-workspace).

1. In a web browser, sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) at `https://portal.azure.com`.
2. Use the **[\>_]** button to the right of the search bar at the top of the page to create a new Cloud Shell in the Azure portal, selecting a ***PowerShell*** environment and creating storage if prompted. The cloud shell provides a command line interface in a pane at the bottom of the Azure portal, as shown here:

    ![Azure portal with a cloud shell pane](./images/cloud-shell.png)

    > **Note**: If you have previously created a cloud shell that uses a *Bash* environment, use the the drop-down menu at the top left of the cloud shell pane to change it to ***PowerShell***.

3. Note that you can resize the cloud shell by dragging the separator bar at the top of the pane, or by using the **&#8212;**, **&#9723;**, and **X** icons at the top right of the pane to minimize, maximize, and close the pane. For more information about using the Azure Cloud Shell, see the [Azure Cloud Shell documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-shell/overview).

4. In the PowerShell pane, enter the following commands to clone this repo:

    ```
    rm -r mslearn-databricks -f
    git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-databricks
    ```

5. After the repo has been cloned, enter the following command to run the **setup.ps1** script, which provisions an Azure Databricks workspace in an available region:

    ```
    ./mslearn-databricks/setup.ps1
    ```

6. If prompted, choose which subscription you want to use (this will only happen if you have access to multiple Azure subscriptions).
7. Wait for the script to complete - this typically takes around 5 minutes, but in some cases may take longer. While you are waiting, review [What is Azure Data Factory?](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/introduction).

## Create an Azure Data Factory resource

In addition to your Azure Databricks workspace, you will need to provision an Azure Data Factory resource in your subscription.

1. In the Azure portal, close the cloud shell pane and browse to the ***msl-*xxxxxxx*** resource group created by the setup script (or the resource group containing your existing Azure Databricks workspace).
1. In the toolbar, select **+ Create** and search for `Data Factory`. Then create a new **Data Factory** resource with the following settings:
    - **Subscription**: *Your subscription*
    - **Resource group**: msl-*xxxxxxx* (or the resource group containing your existing Azure Databricks workspace)
    - **Name**: *A unique name, for example **adf-xxxxxxx***
    - **Region**: *The same region as your Azure databricks workspace (or any other available region if this one is not listed)*
    - **Version**: V2
1. When the new resource is created, verify that the resource group contains both the Azure Databricks workspace and Azure Data Factory resources.

## Create a notebook

You can create notebooks in your Azure Databricks workspace to run code written in a range of programming languages. In this exercise, you'll create a simple notebook that ingests data from a file and saves it in a folder in Databricks File System (DBFS).

1. In the Azure portal, browse to the **msl-*xxxxxxx*** resource group that was created by the script (or the resource group containing your existing Azure Databricks workspace)
1. Select your Azure Databricks Service resource (named **databricks-*xxxxxxx*** if you used the setup script to create it).
1. In the **Overview** page for your workspace, use the **Launch Workspace** button to open your Azure Databricks workspace in a new browser tab; signing in if prompted.

    > **Tip**: As you use the Databricks Workspace portal, various tips and notifications may be displayed. Dismiss these and follow the instructions provided to complete the tasks in this exercise.

1. View the Azure Databricks workspace portal and note that the sidebar on the left side contains icons for the various tasks you can perform.
1. In the sidebar, use the **(+) New** link to create a **Notebook**.
1. Change the default notebook name (**Untitled Notebook *[date]***) to **Process Data**.
1. In the first cell of the notebook, enter (but don't run) the following code to set up a variable for the folder where this notebook will save data.

    ```python
   # Use dbutils.widget define a "folder" variable with a default value
   dbutils.widgets.text("folder", "data")
   
   # Now get the parameter value (if no value was passed, the default set above will be used)
   folder = dbutils.widgets.get("folder")
    ```

1. Under the existing code cell, use the **+** icon to add a new code cell. Then in the new cell, enter (but don't run) the following code to download data and save it to the folder:

    ```python
   import urllib3
   
   # Download product data from GitHub
   response = urllib3.PoolManager().request('GET', 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-databricks/main/data/products.csv')
   data = response.data.decode("utf-8")
   
   # Save the product data to the specified folder
   path = "dbfs:/{0}/products.csv".format(folder)
   dbutils.fs.put(path, data, True)
    ```

1. In the sidebar on the left, select **Workspace** and ensure your **Process Data** notebooks is listed. You'll use Azure data Factory to run the notebook as part of a pipeline.

    > **Note**: The notebook could contain practically any data processing logic you need. This simple example is designed to show the key principles.

## Enable Azure Databricks integration with Azure Data Factory

To use Azure Databricks from an Azure Data Factory pipeline, you need to create a linked service in Azure Data Factory that enables access to your Azure Databricks workspace.

### Generate an access token

1. In the Azure Databricks portal, at on the top right menu bar, select the username and then select **User Settings** from the drop-down.
1. In the **User Settings** page, select **Developer**. Then next to **Access tokens** select **Manage**.
1. Select **Generate new token** and generate a new token with the comment *Data Factory* and a blank lifetime (so the token doesn't expire). Be careful to **copy the token when it is displayed <u>before</u> selecting *Done***.
1. Paste the copied token to a text file so you have it handy for later in this exercise.

### Create a linked service in Azure Data Factory

1. Return to the Azure portal, and in the **msl-*xxxxxxx*** resource group, select the **adf*xxxxxxx*** Azure Data Factory resource.
2. On the **Overview** page, select the **Launch studio** to open the Azure Data Factory Studio. Sign in if prompted.
3. In Azure Data Factory Studio, use the **>>** icon to expand the navigation pane on the left. Then select the **Manage** page.
4. On the **Manage** page, in the **Linked services** tab, select **+ New** to add a new linked service.
5. In the **New linked service** pane, select the **Compute** tab at the top. Then select **Azure Databricks**.
6. Continue, and create the linked service with the following settings:
    - **Name**: AzureDatabricks
    - **Description**: Azure Databricks workspace
    - **Connect via integration runtime**: AutoResolveInegrationRuntime
    - **Account selection method**: From Azure subscription
    - **Azure subscription**: *Select your subscription*
    - **Databricks workspace**: *Select your **databricksxxxxxxx** workspace*
    - **Select cluster**: New job cluster
    - **Databrick Workspace URL**: *Automatically set to your Databricks workspace URL*
    - **Authentication type**: Access token
    - **Access token**: *Paste your access token*
    - **Cluster version**: 13.3 LTS (Spark 3.4.1, Scala 2.12)
    - **Cluster node type**: Standard_DS3_v2
    - **Python version**: 3
    - **Worker options**: Fixed
    - **Workers**: 1

## Use a pipeline to run the Azure Databricks notebook

Now that you have created a linked service, you can use it in a pipeline to run the notebook you viewed previously.

### Create a pipeline

1. In Azure Data Factory Studio, in the navigation pane, select **Author**.
2. On the **Author** page, in the **Factory Resources** pane, use the **+** icon to add a **Pipeline**.
3. In the **Properties** pane for the new pipeline, change its name to **Process Data with Databricks**. Then use the **Properties** button (which looks similar to **&#128463;<sub>*</sub>**) on the right end of the toolbar to hide the **Properties** pane.
4. In the **Activities** pane, expand **Databricks** and drag a **Notebook** activity to the pipeline designer surface.
5. With the new **Notebook1** activity selected, set the following properties in the bottom pane:
    - **General**:
        - **Name**: Process Data
    - **Azure Databricks**:
        - **Databricks linked service**: *Select the **AzureDatabricks** linked service you created previously*
    - **Settings**:
        - **Notebook path**: *Browse to the **Users/your_user_name** folder and select the **Process Data** notebook*
        - **Base parameters**: *Add a new parameter named `folder` with the value `product_data`*
6. Use the **Validate** button above the pipeline designer surface to validate the pipeline. Then use the **Publish all** button to publish (save) it.

### Run the pipeline

1. Above the pipeline designer surface, select **Add trigger**, and then select **Trigger now**.
2. In the **Pipeline run** pane, select **OK** to run the pipeline.
3. In the navigation pane on the left, select **Monitor** and observe the **Process Data with Databricks** pipeline on the **Pipeline runs** tab. It may take a while to run as it dynamically creates a Spark cluster and runs the notebook. You can use the **&#8635; Refresh** button on the **Pipeline runs** page to refresh the status.

    > **Note**: If your pipeline fails, your subscription may have insufficient quota in the region where your Azure Databricks workspace is provisioned to create a job cluster. See [CPU core limit prevents cluster creation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/kb/clusters/azure-core-limit) for details. If this happens, you can try deleting your workspace and creating a new one in a different region. You can specify a region as a parameter for the setup script like this: `./setup.ps1 eastus`

4. When the run succeeds, select its name to view the run details. Then, on the **Process Data with Databricks** page, in the **Activity Runs** section, select the **Process Data** activity and use its ***output*** icon to view the output JSON from the activity, which should resemble this:

    ```json
    {
        "runPageUrl": "https://adb-..../run/...",
        "runOutput": "dbfs:/product_data/products.csv",
        "effectiveIntegrationRuntime": "AutoResolveIntegrationRuntime (East US)",
        "executionDuration": 61,
        "durationInQueue": {
            "integrationRuntimeQueue": 0
        },
        "billingReference": {
            "activityType": "ExternalActivity",
            "billableDuration": [
                {
                    "meterType": "AzureIR",
                    "duration": 0.03333333333333333,
                    "unit": "Hours"
                }
            ]
        }
    }
    ```

5. Note the **runOutput** value, which is the *path* variable to which the notebook saved the data.

## Clean up

If you've finished exploring Azure Databricks, you can delete the resources you've created to avoid unnecessary Azure costs and free up capacity in your subscription.
