# Securing Data in Unity Catalog

Data security is a critical concern for organizations managing sensitive information in their data lakehouse. As data teams collaborate across different roles and departments, ensuring that the right people have access to the right data—while protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access—becomes increasingly complex.

This hands-on lab will demonstrate two powerful Unity Catalog security features that go beyond basic access control:

1. **Row Filtering and Column Masking**: Learn how to protect sensitive data at the table level by hiding specific rows or masking column values based on user permissions
2. **Dynamic Views**: Create intelligent views that automatically adjust what data users can see based on their group memberships and access levels

This lab will take approximately **45** minutes to complete.

> **Note**: The Azure Databricks user interface is subject to continual improvement. The user interface may have changed since the instructions in this exercise were written.

## Provision an Azure Databricks workspace

> **Tip**: If you already have an Azure Databricks workspace, you can skip this procedure and use your existing workspace.

This exercise includes a script to provision a new Azure Databricks workspace. The script attempts to create a *Premium* tier Azure Databricks workspace resource in a region in which your Azure subscription has sufficient quota for the compute cores required in this exercise; and assumes your user account has sufficient permissions in the subscription to create an Azure Databricks workspace resource. 

If the script fails due to insufficient quota or permissions, you can try to [create an Azure Databricks workspace interactively in the Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/getting-started/#--create-an-azure-databricks-workspace).

1. In a web browser, sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) at `https://portal.azure.com`.
2. Use the **[\>_]** button to the right of the search bar at the top of the page to create a new Cloud Shell in the Azure portal, selecting a ***PowerShell*** environment. The cloud shell provides a command line interface in a pane at the bottom of the Azure portal, as shown here:

    ![Azure portal with a cloud shell pane](./images/cloud-shell.png)

    > **Note**: If you have previously created a cloud shell that uses a *Bash* environment, switch it to ***PowerShell***.

3. Note that you can resize the cloud shell by dragging the separator bar at the top of the pane, or by using the **&#8212;**, **&#10530;**, and **X** icons at the top right of the pane to minimize, maximize, and close the pane. For more information about using the Azure Cloud Shell, see the [Azure Cloud Shell documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cloud-shell/overview).

4. In the PowerShell pane, enter the following commands to clone this repo:

    ```
    rm -r mslearn-databricks -f
    git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-databricks
    ```

5. After the repo has been cloned, enter the following command to run the **setup.ps1** script, which provisions an Azure Databricks workspace in an available region:

    ```
    ./mslearn-databricks/setup.ps1
    ```

6. If prompted, choose which subscription you want to use (this will only happen if you have access to multiple Azure subscriptions).
7. Wait for the script to complete - this typically takes around 5 minutes, but in some cases may take longer. While you are waiting, review the [Implement Security and Access Control in Unity Catalog](https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/implement-security-unity-catalog) learn module in the Microsoft Learn.

## Create a Catalog

1. Log in to a workspace that is linked to the metastore.
2. Select **Catalog** from the left menu.
3. Select **Catalogs** below **Quick access**.
4. Select **Create catalog**.
5. On the **Create a new catalog** dialog, enter a **Catalog name** and select the catalog **Type** that you want to create: **Standard** catalog.
6. Specify a managed **Storage location**.

## Create a Notebook

1. In the sidebar, use the **(+) New** link to create a **Notebook**.
   
1. Change the default notebook name (**Untitled Notebook *[date]***) to `Secure data in Unity Catalog` and in the **Connect** drop-down list, select the **Serverless cluster** if it is not already selected.  Be aware that **Serverless** is enabled by default.

1. Copy and run the following code to a new cell in your notebook, in order to configure your working environment for this course. It will also set your default catalog to your specific catalog and the schema to the schema name shown below using the `USE` statements.

```SQL
USE CATALOG `<your catalog>`;
USE SCHEMA `default`;
```

1. Run the code below and confirm that your current catalog is set to your unique catalog name and that the current schema is **default**.

```sql
SELECT current_catalog(), current_schema()
```

## Protect Columns and Rows with Column Masking and Row Filtering

### Create the Table Customers

1. Run the code below to create the **customers** table in your **default** schema.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE customers AS
SELECT *
FROM samples.tpch.customer;
```

2. Run a query to view *10* rows from the **customers** table in your **default** schema. Notice that the table contains information such as **c_name**, **c_phone**, and **c_mktsegment**.
   
```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers  
LIMIT 10;
```

### Create a Function to Perform Column Masking

View the [Filter sensitive table data using row filters and column masks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/data-governance/unity-catalog/filters-and-masks/) documentation for additional help.

1. Create a function named **phone_mask** that redacts the **c_phone** column in the **customers** table if the user is not a member of the ('admin') group using the `is_account_group_member` function. The **phone_mask** function should return the string *REDACTED PHONE NUMBER* if the user is not a member.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION phone_mask(c_phone STRING)
  RETURN CASE WHEN is_account_group_member('metastore_admins') 
    THEN c_phone 
    ELSE 'REDACTED PHONE NUMBER' 
  END;
```

2. Apply the column masking function **phone_mask** to the **customers** table using the `ALTER TABLE` statement.

```sql
ALTER TABLE customers 
  ALTER COLUMN c_phone 
  SET MASK phone_mask;
```

3. Run the query below to view the **customers** table with the column mask applied. Confirm that the **c_phone** column displays the value *REDACTED PHONE NUMBER*.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
LIMIT 10;
```

### Create a Function to Perform Row Filtering

View the [Filter sensitive table data using row filters and column masks](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/data-governance/unity-catalog/filters-and-masks/) documentation for additional help.

1. Run the code below to count the total number of rows in the **customers** table. Confirm that the table contains 750,000 rows of data.

```sql
SELECT count(*) AS TotalRows
FROM customers;
```

2. Create a function named **nation_filter** that filters on **c_nationkey** in the **customers** table if the user is not a member of the ('admin') group using the `is_account_group_member` function. The function should only return rows where **c_nationkey** equals *21*.

    View the [if function](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/sql/language-manual/functions/if) documentation for additional help.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION nation_filter(c_nationkey INT)
  RETURN IF(is_account_group_member('admin'), true, c_nationkey = 21);
```

3. Apply the function row filtering function `nation_filter` to the **customers** table using the `ALTER TABLE` statement.

```sql
ALTER TABLE customers 
SET ROW FILTER nation_filter ON (c_nationkey);
```

4. Run the query below to count the number of rows in the **customers** table for you since you've filtered out rows for users not admins. Confirm you can only view *29,859* rows (*where c_nationkey = 21*). 

```sql
SELECT count(*) AS TotalRows
FROM customers;
```

5. Run the query below to view the **customers** table. 

    Confirm the final table:
    - redactes the **c_phone** column and
    - filters rows based on the **c_nationkey** column for users who are not *admins*.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers;
```

## Protecting Columns and Rows with Dynamic Views

### Create the Table Customers_new

1. Run the code below to create the **customers_new** table in your **default** schema.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE customers_new AS
SELECT *
FROM samples.tpch.customer;
```

2. Run a query to view *10* rows from the **customers_new** table in your **default** schema. Notice that the table contains information such as **c_name**, **c_phone**, and **c_mktsegment**.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers_new
LIMIT 10;
```

### Create the Dynamic View

Let's create a view named **vw_customers** that presents a processed view of the **customers_new** table data with the following transformations:

- Selects all columns from the **customers_new** table.

- Redact all values in the **c_phone** column to *REDACTED PHONE NUMBER* unless you are in the `is_account_group_member('admins')`
    - HINT: Use a `CASE WHEN` statement in the `SELECT` clause.

- Restrict the rows where **c_nationkey** is equal to *21* unless you are in the `is_account_group_member('admins')`.
    - HINT: Use a `CASE WHEN` statement in the `WHERE` clause.

```sql
-- Create a movies_gold view by redacting the "votes" column and restricting the movies with a rating below 6.0

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW vw_customers AS
SELECT 
  c_custkey, 
  c_name, 
  c_address, 
  c_nationkey,
  CASE 
    WHEN is_account_group_member('admins') THEN c_phone
    ELSE 'REDACTED PHONE NUMBER'
  END as c_phone,
  c_acctbal, 
  c_mktsegment, 
  c_comment
FROM customers_new
WHERE
  CASE WHEN
    is_account_group_member('admins') THEN TRUE
    ELSE c_nationkey = 21
  END;
```

3. Display the data in the **vw_customers** view. Confirm the **c_phone** column is redacted. Confirm the **c_nationkey** is equal to *21* unless you're the administrator.

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM vw_customers;
```

6. Count the number of rows in the **vw_customers** view. Confirm the view contains *29,859* rows.

```sql
SELECT count(*)
FROM vw_customers;
```

### Issue Grant Access to View

1. Let us issue a grant for "account users" to view the **vw_customers** view.

**NOTE:** You will also need to provide users access to the catalog and schema. In this shared training environment, you are unable to grant access to your catalog to other users.

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON VIEW vw_customers TO `account users`
```

2. Use the `SHOW` statement to displays all privileges (inherited, denied, and granted) that affect the **vw_customers** view. Confirm that the **Principal** column contains *account users*.

    View the [SHOW GRANTS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/sql/language-manual/security-show-grant) documentation for help.

```sql
SHOW GRANTS ON vw_customers
```
